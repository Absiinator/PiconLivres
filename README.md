## Creation of a recommandation system for books

This project have us crating a recommandation system for books.\
The early results indicate a 90% succesful rate.\
We do not intend to go higher because sometimes books are better met with luck.\
But results will be processed through a filtering algorithm to better determine what one may like or already own.

Model is based on user_id, book_id and ratings only from Goodread database.
Data is provided.

If you are to train the model yourself, it is avaible in TrainSVDonGoodRead.ipynb.
